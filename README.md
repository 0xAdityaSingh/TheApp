# Abstract
The alignment of genomic data takes a significant amount of time and
for someone who is attending a conference or currently does not have
access to their HPC, they would be required to wait to get to their
workspace to even get the process started.
Our application, one would just need to enter the Accession ID on
their mobile and the downloading followed by the alignment of the data
with the reference genome will begin automatically on the connected
HPC. This would be a time saver for anyone whose work includes the
alignment of such data.
